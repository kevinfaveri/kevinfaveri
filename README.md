## Hi, I'm Kevin Faveri!

I'm a product oriented software engineer with 9+ years of experience in the finance (tradfi and web3) and educational sectors.
I actively contribute to open source engaging with the community through mine and others projects.
Driven by curiosity, I'm always exploring new tech and paradigms to innovate.
